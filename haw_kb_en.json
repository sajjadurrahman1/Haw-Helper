    "text": "HAW-Hamburg: Applying for a Bachelor's degree course Application Applying for a Bachelor's degree course Applying for a technical degree course Applying without Hochschulstart Application with Hochschulstart Admission requirements Contact information There are different application processes for the various Bachelor's degree courses. For most of the courses, you are required to register with the dialogue-oriented service procedure (Hochschulstart) before you can sign into our online application portal and apply. There are some exceptions, especially for the artistic and cooperative degree courses. General application deadlines ................................................................................................................................................................................................ Winter semester: 1 June–15 July Summer semester: 1 December–15 January The deadlines for some degree courses are different. You can find more information on the specific degree course page . Please also note that the application deadlines are the final deadlines. Applications received after these closing dates will not be considered. Hochschulstart ................................................................................................................................................................................................ Most of the Bachelor's degree courses at HAW Hamburg participate in the Hochschulstart dialogue-oriented service procedure (DoSV). You can currently apply for one HAW Hamburg degree course through Hochschulstart; you can apply for a maximum of twelve degree courses countrywide. An application for multiple programmes that includes degree courses which are not part of the DoSV is not possible. You can look at the degree courses page to find out whether you can apply for the winter or the summer semester of the particular degree course. The following degree courses do not take part in the DoSV: Illustration Communication Design Fashion, Costume and Textile Product Design Information Engineering Mechanical Engineering all degree courses that are studied in dual form For the Nursing and Public Management degree courses, which are offered exclusively as cooperative degree programmes, you apply for the training position and your place in the degree course directly through the organisation providing the training. You can find more information on the specific degree course pages. Hochschulstart application process Please start by registering for the DoSV at hochschulstart.de. Once you have registered successfully you will be assigned a BID (applicant ID) and a BAN (applicant authentification number). Both of these numbers will be required later when you submit your application via the myHAW application and student portal. The application process consists of several phases. You can find detailed information about the DoSV and the coordination phases at hochschulstart.de . View application status You can check the status of your application and our university's admissions offers (from the end of January for the summer semester / from the end of July for the winter semester) in both your user account for the Hochschulstart application portal and the myHAW information and application portal. Accept your offer of admission As soon as a decision has been made you about your application, you will be notified via Hochschulstart and myHAW. If an offer of admission has been made through Hochschulstart, you need to actively accept the offer on Hochschulstart in order to receive an admissions offer from us. If we are unable to offer you a study place by the end of the process, you will receive",

Study without Abitur or Fachhochschulreife ................................................................................................................................................................................................ Under the Hamburg Higher Education Act, you can also study without an Abitur or Fachhochschulreife certificate. Individuals with the following qualifications have higher education entrance eligibility: Master tradespeople ( Meister*innen ) in accordance with the Crafts and Trades Code ( Handwerksordnung ) Certified business administrators ( Fachwirt*innen ) Individuals with equivalent advanced studies certificates in accordance with sections 53 and 54 of the Vocational Training Act. Applicants who receive a grade of 2,0 or better on their aptitude test for a Design degree at HAW Hamburg and are at least 18 years old can also be admitted without a higher education entrance qualification. If you do not belong to one of the above groups and therefore do not have a higher education entrance qualification, you can take an entrance exam pursuant to section 38 of the Hamburg Education Act in order to obtain this qualification. Selection criteria for the allocation of study places ................................................................................................................................................................................................ For most degree courses, whether or not you receive a place in the particular course is determined by the final grade you received for your higher education entrance qualification or by your wait time. The exact limit ( numerus clausus ) on the number of applicants that can be admitted is only ascertained once the ranking list has been generated based on the information (grades and wait times) from the current applications. This means that for each degree course, the numerus clausus only becomes clear at the end of each admissions process. Note: The criteria 'achievement' and 'wait time' are evaluated separately, which means that a longer wait time does not improve the average grade. Numerus clausus table (from the last admissions process; in German only) Conversion from grades into points (in German only) Admissions procedure (in German only) Additional criteria In some cases the average grade is only one of several criteria. In certain degree courses, the grades for particular subjects are weighted differently and some are not taken into account in the calculation of points. The following Bachelor's degree courses have different selection criteria. These are outlined in detail in the admissions regulations: Clothing Technology and Management, Admissions policy (in German only) Information Engineering, Admissions policy Mechanical Engineering, Admissions policy Mechanical Engineering and Production Admissions policy (in German only) Media Technology, Admissions policy (in German only) An artistic aptitude test must be completed before an application can be submitted for the following degree courses: Illustration Communication Design Fashion, Costume and Textile Design Hardship provisions ................................................................................................................................................................................................ Applicants with a disability or a chronic illness can submit a hardship application in accordance with the HAW Hamburg's Hardship Policy. This provides an extra chance of obtaining a study place. Five per cent of the study places in each BA degree course are allocated for applicants with particular health, familial, financial or social difficulties.

Please remember: The police or another investigative authority does not call them and never ask them to name personal data on the phone. Other authorities or banks do not make such calls.

In addition, the perpetrators could try to get further data from you in the course of calls to use them for further criminal activities. How should you react? 1. Do not follow the instructions, do not let yourself be involved in a conversation and do not reveal any data! Write down the phone number and put on. 2.

The aim of the attackers is to get further personal data or to infiltrate their end devices with appropriate malware. How should you react? Always check the sender of incoming emails by clicking on the sender address. However, also note that even known senders could be fake or unauthorized by strangers. Pay attention to spelling errors or similar abnormalities (e.g. missing salutation, other language, alleged urgent need for action)-this also indicates a phishing email. Do not open any systems and links in suspicious emails. The systems and links in such emails can be malware / malware that causes damage to your device unnoticed or personal data, e.g. account details, deducts from your device that are used for further criminal acts.

Immediately file a criminal complaint if your identity has been misused. In the criminal complaint with the police, please also refer to the police file number to the cyber attack: LKA541/1K/0870845/2022 if the abuse can be connected to the cyber attack on HAW Hamburg and the publication of your data in the Darknet. If invoices, reminders or packages are sent to you, it is best to contact the sending companies in person (be careful with alleged invoices that are sent to you by email, because the subject \"Invoice\" or similar are not infrequently sent files that install malware on your device). Note that judicial dunning notices may have to be contradicted on time. If necessary, report identity abuse with the large economic information files; Corresponding forms can be found, among other things, at: schufa.de and cifbuergel.de. If you want to be sure that crimes, such as the fraud, have not already been committed with your identity data, you may be able to apply for free self -disclosure at the common economic information, such as Schufa or CRR, to determine whether unknown perpetrators were already active in your name. If you find that fraud is committed in your name, it may also make sense to have a so -called registration in the large economic information files made in order to make abuse of your identity more difficult by unknown perpetrators. In this case, however, note that the contractual partners of the economic information files receive a note that your data is saved as a victim of identity. This can cause your own contracts to be subjected to a separate examination. This may lead to additional documents or extended identification requested and the processing times are extended.

Social networks and entertainment pages are among the most common goals of phishing attacks.

One of the most comprehensive of these services is Have I Been Pwned, which you can reach at havellenpwned.com. If you receive the message \"Oh No-Pwnded\", this means that this email address was published by one or more data leaks. Which ones are, is published on the website mentioned. With particular urgency, for you, what everyone should consider anyway: 1. Select a strong password. 2. Use a two-factor authentication wherever possible. 3.

Safe passwords ..................................................................................................................................................................................................................... Good passwords serve your own security! This is to be explained by a few examples. Unsafe passwords can be found very quickly by so -called 'crackers' by simply trying it out. These people are usually not about stealing data, changing or reading foreign emails, but they are looking for an account that they can carry out their criminal activities undisturbed. This can be attacked against individual computers, planned \"Denial of Service\" attacks against entire networks (as examples from the recent past, attacks against Yahoo, Amazon and various IRC servers) or about trading in children's pornography or similar. In each of these cases, the suspicion first falls on the owner of the cracked account. This is usually associated with considerable inconvenience (house searches, interrogation by the police/public prosecutor, etc.). You can significantly reduce the risk of sacrificing such a 'confusion' by changing your passwords regularly and also paying attention to the safety of the passwords. Before we want to show you what safe passwords look like, we want to show you how passwords shouldn't look at all.",

    "text": "To do this, we strive for our sample user Stefan Mustermann with the user recognition SU2476. Of course, passwords such as \"Stefan\", \"Stefanm\", \"SSU2476M\" or similar combinations of name and user recognition would be simple. However, these are also extremely insecure, since when the passwords cracken, the user's known data is first worked on. Passwords such as \"Stfnmstrmnn\" (first and last name without vowels), \"Stefan28\" (he is 28 years old), \"19SM72\" (born in 1972) or \"Nafets\" (first name) are found just as quickly. Data with a personal cover are therefore not suitable as passwords. The next simple alternative is to use normal words. But this is also extremely unsure, because the cracker will try his luck with dictionaries with user -related data. Each word of this dictionary is in turn tested in several combinations and variations as a password. For example, \"Internet\" also becomes \"Tenretni\" or \"1n7ers37\" or \"NTRT22\" or or or. Dictionaries do not only contain all words of a specific language. They are usually multilingual and also contain all common first and last names. There are also dictionaries on special subject areas such as computers, literature, Internet, medicine, fantasy or science fiction. This means that words like \"Appendix\", \"Zaphod\", \"NCC1701\" or \"Bond007\" are unsuitable. So let's try nonsensical combinations of letters and numbers. Many users simply love it, so keyboard combinations such as \"ABC123\", \"1234QWer\", \"1Q2W3E4R\", \"ABC: 123\" or \"0987Poiu\" have long been known and therefore no longer constitute any security. and are very easy to crack depending on the version. Nevertheless, it is very easy to derive safe and easily noticeable passwords. Take a sentence that you can personally remember. From every word of this sentence, you now take the first letter (keeping up and small and lower case) and also possible punctuation marks, and line them up. For example, the sentence \"A safe password consists of at least 10 characters.\" The password \"ESPBAM10Z.\". It's that simple. Of course, you can also find this password by trying it with enough long computing time, but usually not within 100 days - and then a new password should already apply. Briefly summarized: Do not use user -related data in passwords. Do not use known words - no matter which area they may come from. Do not use 'simple' keyboard combinations (e.g. side and side buttons) Unix and network password do not choose identical. It is best to choose a well noticeable sentence, and from it together the initial letters of the individual words come together to a password. Note on the use of codes for MS-Teams invitations ........................................................................................................................................................ In order to further increase IT security at HAW Hamburg, invitations to public MS team channels not to be communicated via a codes. Background: In particular, phishing emails often contain the requests: \"Click this link\". With the code, this source of danger is minimized and students and employees sensitize this possible risk. Here you will find instructions on generating the code (this is only possible as a channel owner) and to join an MS team channel via code. Information security guideline",
